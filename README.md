# jiggy
Jiggy is a soon-to-come all-in-one media downloader/utility. A third-party hosting service is not needed! Instead, it uses localhost, which means it hosts for you, and only for you!

# Fear not!
The source is inside the project! So if you are untrusting or as paranoid as people who wear tinfoil hats because *the government*, the source is yours to look over or build the project from scratch. You can also VirusTotal it if you'd like.

# Versions
setup_updating is for a separate version of the program. If a new build is released, it will be automatically downloaded for you, nothing else.
setup_normal is for the base version of the program, which does not auto-update.
